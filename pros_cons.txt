| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ❌ No semantic understanding         | "pyare" vs. "achhe" treated as completely unrelated                      |
| ❌ Poor generalization               | If prefix never seen, it fails                                           |
| ❌ Corpus-biased                     | TMKOC or IndicCorp biases predictions                                    |

| ❌ Roman script only                 | Devanagari input not yet supported                                       |
